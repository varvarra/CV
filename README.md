I'm a **full-stack junior software developer** with experience in Ruby, JavaScript, Node.js, SQL, NoSQL, MVC, TDD and OOD.

I can offer integrity, team devotion, a desire to constantly learn and improve from day 1, with a positive, flexible can-do attitude.

I'm excited to work in a challenging and open environment on engaging projects with like-minded life-loving people that work with endless enthusiasm.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic communicator and collaborator

- I have been involved in different communication roles from producing daily media briefings and maintaining social media presence to assisting in coordinating and hosting major events.

#### Self-starter with a can-do attitude

- Museum experience creator for children, centered around the "Information Age" and "Space" themes of the Science Museum. Received a lot of **positive feedback** and further event requests. I was **taking a risk**, which was worth every minute of it as it was done with conviction.
I've enjoyed researching, improving my knowledge base, and most of all, sharing that knowledge with others.
