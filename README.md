## Varvara Shinkarenko


I am a technology enthusiast looking to understand the world a little better and help others understand it better still. To this end I have studied Educational Planning at a Masters Level all the while keeping my finger on the pulse of the world of EdTech. I would like to streamline and solidify some ideas about fusing the social and the technological aspects of education, inspiration, and the spread of knowledge; I would love to work on start-ups in this field, perhaps even developing some ideas of my own. The environment that interests me is challenging, colorful, saturated with the beat of endless enthusiasm of like-minded happy life-loving people.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic communicator

In my current work as a part-time teacher and as a recent tour guide at the Science Museum I had a great chance to put my communication skills to a test every time I gave tour or a lesson. It required not only preparation but sincere interest in the topic I shared knowledge about. I feel as confident in communicating by email as much as by person. During my work as a volunteer in organisations like "Peace One Day", "London International Development Center", "Russian Education Center" I produced daily and weekly media briefings, maintained and improved the ‘social media’ presence, assisted with coordinating and hosting of the annual events, which all required me being very well-organized

#### Fast enthusiastic learner
‘Start Up’ venture, accordingly involvement in

During my work in the educational robotics startup Indybo I expereinced the early-stage business environment, requiring a lot of flexibility and an entrepreneurial approach across the range. I organised the User/Market Testing of the product with 5 to 8 year old children – with the key concepts communicated with schools and parents for feedback purposes.
•	Preparing a Marketing Analysis for the product in the field I had no previous knowledge in. I learned a lot about the field of recreational robotics and could produce further strategy recommendations for the company, requiring me to focus on the key influencing factors/details whilst researching information and originating plans.
