I am a technology enthusiast looking to understand the world a little better and help others understand it better still. To this end I have studied Educational Planning at a Masters Level all the while keeping my finger on the pulse of the world of EdTech. I would like to streamline and solidify some ideas about fusing the social and the technological aspects of education, inspiration, and the spread of knowledge; The environment that interests me is challenging, saturated with the beat of endless enthusiasm of like-minded life-loving people that enjoy best OOD practices, TDD and pair programming.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic communicator

I enjoy helping and motivating others, connecting with people and working in teams.
In my current work as a teacher and as a recent tour guide I had a great chance to put my communication skills to a test every time I gave a tour or a lesson. It required not only preparation but sincere interest in the topic I shared knowledge about. I feel confident expressing myself and I am good listener. During my short experiences at different workplaces I was involved in different processes from producing daily and weekly media briefings, maintaining ‘social media’ presence to assisting coordinating and hosting of the annual events

#### Curious learner

During my work in the educational robotics startup, Indybo, I experienced an early-stage business environment, requiring a lot of **flexibility** and an entrepreneurial approach across the range.
I also prepared a Marketing Analysis for the product in the field I had barely any previous knowledge in. I learned a lot about the field of recreational robotics and took it as a an exciting opportunity to produce a small report for strategy recommendations for the company, requiring me to focus on the key influencing factors/details whilst researching information and originating plans.


#### Self-starter

Previous year I decided to organise my personal tours for children around "Information Age" and "Space" galleries of the Science Museum. Being well-organised and confident that I can deliver a difficult material to a group 10-year olds was crucial for my success. I received lots of positive feedback. I was taking a risk, but it was worth every minute of it.
I really enjoyed preparing information, learning a lot in the process, and, most of all, sharing my knowledge with others.


#### Other Skills

- Foreign languages: Russian (Native), French (Post-Intermediate),  Spanish and Portuguese (Basic)
