## Interests

I am a lifelong learner with special interests in education, science, and the big history of our world. I nurture my interests by reading and attending various events at various institutes in London.
My main interest lies within area of childrenâ€™s education. I try to follow the latest research and trends happening in the area of educational technology and I try to get involved in various educational festivals/events for children. Recently I have been volunteering as a team leader in an international summer school for teenagers in Barcelona this August, and have been assisting in the events organised by the Institute of Imagination (London).
