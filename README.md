I'm a **full-stack junior software developer** who worked in the field of children's education and international development before embarking on a new and exciting coding journey.

I can offer *integrity, a desire to constantly learn and improve, creative approach and a positive, flexible can-do attitude* from day one. I also widely use and value **OOP and TDD** as my main coding practices and would be ready and willing to grow in these and other best techniques.

I'm eager to work in a challenging and vibrant environment on engaging projects with variety of new technologies in a company of like-minded life-loving individuals :smiley:
