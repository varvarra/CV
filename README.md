## Varvara Shinkarenko

I am a technology enthusiast looking to understand the world a little better and help others understand it better still. To this end I have studied Educational Planning at a Masters Level all the while keeping my finger on the pulse of the world of EdTech. I would like to streamline and solidify some ideas about fusing the social and the technological aspects of education, inspiration, and the spread of knowledge; I would love to work in this field, perhaps even developing some ideas of my own. The environment that interests me is challenging, saturated with the beat of endless enthusiasm of like-minded happy life-loving people.

## Skills

#### Enthusiastic communicator


I enjoy helping and motivating others, connecting with people and working in teams.
In my current work as a teacher and as a recent tour guide I had a great chance to put my communication skills to a test every time I gave a tour or a lesson. It required not only preparation but sincere interest in the topic I shared knowledge about. I feel as confident in expressing myself and I am very good at listening. During my work as in organisations I produced daily and weekly media briefings, maintained and improved the ‘social media’ presence, assisted with coordinating and hosting of the annual events, which all required me being well-organised and self-confident

#### Fast enthusiastic learner

During my work in the educational robotics startup Indybo I experienced an early-stage business environment, requiring a lot of flexibility and an entrepreneurial approach across the range. I enjoyed being part of the tech movement. I organised the User/Market Testing of the product with 5 to 8 year old children – with the key concepts communicated with schools and parents for feedback purposes.
I also prepared a Marketing Analysis for the product in the field I had barely any previous knowledge in. I learned a lot about the field of recreational robotics and could produce further strategy recommendations for the company, requiring me to focus on the key influencing factors/details whilst researching information and originating plans.


#### Self-starter

I organised my personal tours(in Russian) for children around the Science Museum "Information Age" and "Space" galleries.
